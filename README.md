#Lessons Learned
- Use Inheritance from an Abstract Class, the subclass can use parent fields and methods without declaring its own to avoid repetition.
- Split the code block to test individually
- Debug code lines when needed
- Add more than one value to Enum fields
- Create Object that has fields as other objects
- Combine while loop and if else for covering scenarios that stop the game and/or turn
